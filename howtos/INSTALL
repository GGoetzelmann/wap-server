To install (and run) this application from the source code the following prerequisites have to be met:

- maven installed (tested with different version of 3.5.x)
  INFO : maven issues error messages concerning the version if a too old one is used
- git
- java 1.8 or newer

1. clone repository from scc github
git clone https://git.scc.kit.edu/DEM-PSE/PSE-SoSe2018/Implementierung.git

2. cd into local repo and run maven
mvn clean verify
INFO: Should tests not run without errors use --DskipTests (not happening with version tagged pse-final) 
INFO: Some operating system may have problems with some special charactes in the UTF-8 encoded filenames.
      This has happened on FreeBSD 11.2. These files are not needed and kept in the same repo just because
      no separate one existed back then. Just delete them.

3. This creates the application jar under target/

4. Copy this jar to the folder where the product should be installed.
This may be a different host. To run the jar, only java >= 1.8 is needed. 
This folder should be empty. If not, auto-installation does not work and has to be manually started via --install

5. Follow the installation procedure, all steps are explained there.

To start the server afterwards run java -jar xxx.jar where xxx.jar is the file created under step 3

ATTENTION: Some OS do not allow normal users to listen to "low" ports. It may be necessary to start the application
with admin/root privileges then, depending on the ports used.

This procedure has been tested with version tagged pse-final on:
- Windows 10 x64
- Windows 7 x32
- Windows Server 2012 R2 x64
- Windows Server 2016 x64
- Centos 6.10 x32  (maven needs manual install, Centos version is too old)
- Centos 7.5 x64  (maven needs manual install, Centos version is too old)
- Ubuntu 18.04 x64
- FreeBSD 11.2 x64  (Problems with special characters in the Document folder exist. These files are not needed to generate the application, delete them)
- MacOS High Sierra version 10.13.6 x64 (manual install mode needed via --install as MacOS auto-creates .DSstore file)

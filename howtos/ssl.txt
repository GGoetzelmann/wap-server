To run the WAP Server with HTTPS, a valid key-store has to exist under ssl/

Here are example steps that can be used with openssl to create a self signed certificate for this purpose.
It has to be adapted to use officially signed certificates. Since these are usually created by provider-dependent tools,
consult the documentation of the registry selected to provide them.

# Create key file, enter the key password twice
# You are asked for a password, further written as PrivateKeyPw
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out wap.key 4096

# Create certificate file. numerous question getting asked. Either fill them appropriately or just accept defaults
# When asked for common name, you may provide the hostname you have entered before. This is not required.
# -days provides the validity in days
openssl req -new -x509 -key wap.key -out wap.crt -days 3650

# Convert the files to pkcs12
# You are again asked for a password, further written as KeyStorePw
openssl pkcs12 -inkey wap.key -in wap.crt -export -out wap.pkcs12

Finally copy the keystore to ssl/ (or execute openssl in this directory)

Within the autocreated ssl.conf, replace the values as needed.

Default text for ssl.conf:

key-store-file=wap.pkcs12
key-store-password=KeyStorePw
key-password=PrivateKeyPw
server.ssl.alias=1

The key alias is 1 if imported without any further options. if it does not fit or has been changed, adapt it.

Problems:

Question : I do not know the alias of the key ? 
Answer : To list the aliases in a store type keytool -list -keystore .\wap.pkcs12

Question : I get an "cannot recover the key" Exception ?
Answer: There are some posts out there telling that the two passwords need to be the same
        to solve this problem. We never had this issue.
